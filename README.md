# TesterUtilities - Chrome Extension for Testing

## Project Description

A Chrome extension that combines context menu tools with a user scripts manager. Started as a simple testing utility with generators and form fillers, now expanded to include custom JavaScript execution, data persistence and configurable settings. The extension provides various testing tools like data generators, form manipulation utilities, and text processing features. All functionalities can be accessed through the context menu or managed via a dedicated settings panel. Built with TypeScript and Parcel.

üåê Available on Chrome Web Store: [TesterUtilities](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/testerutilities/lmlfadbikkafmfacnbdlcjaehopomkii)

## Installation

### Clone

Clone this repo to your local machine using

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Pawel-Albert/utilities-for-testing-extension.git
```

### Setup

Type in terminal

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

A folder "dist" should be created. Go to chrome://extensions/. While in developer mode use "load unpacked" extension option and choose "dist" folder. Extension now is ready to use (remember to allow for use in incognito mode if needed).

## Features

All features are available in the context menu, organized into logical groups. After right-clicking, hover over TesterUtilities to see the following groups:

### Data Generators

- "Generate PESEL (18+)" - Generates valid Polish PESEL number (for adults)
- "Generate IBAN" - Generates valid IBAN number
- "Generate ID number" - Generates valid Polish ID number
- "Generate PASSPORT number" - Generates valid Polish passport number
- "Generate valid PL mobile phone" - Generates valid Polish mobile phone number
- "Generate valid PL NIP" - Generates valid Polish NIP (tax identification number)
- "Generate valid PL REGON" - Generates valid Polish REGON number

### Text Tools

- "Generate Counter String" - Generates a counter string with specified length
- "Generate Lorem Ipsum" - Generates Lorem Ipsum text with specified length
- "Multiply Text in Lines" - Multiplies given text in multiple lines with specified parameters
- "Generate Text Pattern" - Generates various text patterns based on input text

### Form Tools

- "Remove all 'disabled' attributes" - Removes all disabled attributes from form elements
- "Clear all input restrictions" - Removes typical input restrictions
- "Change all inputs type from password to text" - Converts password fields to text fields
- "Highlight elements with same ID" - Highlights elements with duplicate IDs
- "Highlight and show all 'display none' elements" - Shows hidden elements

### Form Fillers

- "Simple form filler - default site" - Auto-fills forms on default site (Alt+2)
- "Simple form filler - custom sites" - Auto-fills forms on custom sites (Alt+3)

To configure form fillers for your sites, you can now use the Custom Site Selectors feature. This provides a user-friendly interface for adding and managing your site configurations without having to modify the code.

#### Custom Site Selectors

The extension now offers a dedicated UI for managing custom site selectors accessible through the options page. You can:

1. **Add new site configurations** with a simple JSON editor
2. **Import/export** configurations to share them between browsers or with colleagues
3. **View and edit** existing configurations
4. **Test and preview** your selectors

Here's an example of the new JSON configuration format:

```javascript
{
  "email": {
    "selector": "input[name='email']",
    "type": "input",
    "dataType": "function",
    "dataGenerator": "generateRandomEmail"
  },
  "password": {
    "selector": "input[type='password']",
    "type": "input",
    "data": "SecurePassword123!"
  },
  "firstName": {
    "selector": "input[name='firstName']",
    "type": "input",
    "dataType": "function",
    "dataGenerator": "fakerFirstName"
  },
  "dropdown": {
    "type": "multiStep",
    "selector": ".dropdown",
    "timeout": 500,
    "steps": [
      {
        "selector": ".dropdown-toggle",
        "type": "simpleClick"
      },
      {
        "selector": ".dropdown-item",
        "type": "simpleClick",
        "index": 2
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Key features of the new system:

- **Multiple domain support** with pipe separator: `example.com|test.org`
- **Wildcard matching** for subdomains: `*.example.com`
- **Dynamic data generators** with parameters: `fakerZipCode:##-###:pl`
- **Multi-step interactions** for complex forms
- **Support for shadow DOM** and other complex UI elements
- **Multiple action types**: input, click, checkbox, and more

For detailed documentation, visit the Site Selectors page in the extension options.

### Console Tools

- "JSON prettier via console" - Formats JSON and prints to console
- "Timestamp to date" - Converts timestamp to readable date
- "Base64 decode and print to console" - Decodes Base64 string
- "Base64 encode and print to console" - Encodes string to Base64

### Domain Tools

- "Switch domain" - Switches between domains (Alt+1) - Company-specific feature, currently configured only for internal company domains. To use it for different domains, the configuration needs to be modified in the source code.

## Configuration

The extension now includes configuration options for both form filling and text generators, accessible through the extension's options page:
